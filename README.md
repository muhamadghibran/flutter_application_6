## Introduction to Visible and Invisible Widgets

In Flutter, widgets are the building blocks of the user interface. They can be categorized into two types:

- **Visible Widgets**: These are widgets that are directly visible on the screen, such as `Text`, `Icon`, and `Button`. They are used for displaying content or receiving user input.
  
- **Invisible Widgets**: These are widgets that are not directly visible but are used to control the layout and positioning of other widgets. Examples include `Column`, `Row`, and `Center`.

---

## Visible Widgets

Visible widgets are the ones you can see and interact with on the screen. Some common examples include:

- **Text**: Displays a string of text.
- **Icon**: Displays an icon from the Material Icons library.
- **Button**: Allows users to perform actions when clicked.

These widgets are essential for creating interactive and visually appealing UIs.

---

## Invisible Widgets

Invisible widgets, also known as **layout widgets**, are used to arrange and position other widgets. They are not visible themselves but play a crucial role in structuring the UI. Some key examples include:

- **Column**: Arranges widgets vertically.
- **Row**: Arranges widgets horizontally.
- **Stack**: Overlays widgets on top of each other.

## Container Widget: The Hybrid

The **Container** widget is unique because it can act as both a visible and an invisible widget. It is often used to wrap other widgets and apply styling, such as padding, margins, and colors.

```dart
Container(
  width: 200,
  height: 50,
  color: Colors.green,
  child: Text('Hello, Flutter!'),
)
```

---

## Layout Widgets

### Column Widget

The `Column` widget arranges its children vertically. By default, it takes up the maximum height available and aligns its children from top to bottom.

```dart
Column(
  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center, // Aligns children vertically
  crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start, // Aligns children horizontally
  children: [
    Container(width: 200, height: 50, color: Colors.green),
    Container(width: 50, height: 50, color: Colors.blue),
    Container(width: 100, height: 50, color: Colors.amber),
  ],
)
```

### Row Widget

The `Row` widget arranges its children horizontally. It takes up the maximum width available and aligns its children from left to right.

```dart
Row(
  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween, // Aligns children horizontally
  crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center, // Aligns children vertically
  children: [
    Container(width: 50, height: 200, color: Colors.green),
    Container(width: 50, height: 50, color: Colors.blue),
    Container(width: 50, height: 100, color: Colors.amber),
  ],
)
```

### Stack Widget

The `Stack` widget overlays its children on top of each other. The last child in the list will be displayed on top.

```dart
Stack(
  children: [
    Container(width: 300, height: 300, color: Colors.red),
    Container(width: 200, height: 200, color: Colors.green),
    Container(width: 100, height: 100, color: Colors.blue),
  ],
)
```

## Practical Example

Letâ€™s create a simple Flutter app that uses `Column`, `Row`, and `Stack` widgets.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Layouts')),
        body: Column(
          children: [
            Row(
              children: [
                Container(width: 50, height: 50, color: Colors.green),
                Container(width: 50, height: 50, color: Colors.blue),
              ],
            ),
            Stack(
              children: [
                Container(width: 200, height: 200, color: Colors.red),
                Container(width: 100, height: 100, color: Colors.yellow),
              ],
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
